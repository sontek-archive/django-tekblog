# This provides for an app that is a slim version of a blog inspired by 
# django mingus. This includes a blog that provides for series, tagging, 
# draft/published, search, feeds, 'related posts', featured and paginator.

# The base views include:
# index, detail, search

# Index uses the paginator from django.core
# Search leverages haystack.

# Ensure that you have the following installed apps for this to function:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.comments',
    'tagging',
    'haystack',
    'tekblog',
)

# For haystack to function, you will need to have the settings:
HAYSTACK_SITECONF = 'yourpackage.search_sites'
HAYSTACK_SEARCH_ENGINE = 'whoosh'
HAYSTACK_WHOOSH_PATH = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'haystack')

# yourpackage.search_sites should refer to a search_sites.py within your site dir
# search_sites.py is what allows haystack to autodiscover
import haystack
haystack.autodiscover()

# You will also need to create the actual index folder for haystack
# that is located on the path you provided above for whoosh
